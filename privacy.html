            <h2>1. Why is my information needed?</h2>
            <p>The Service is web based and is therefore required to store a small amount of information about you, your usage, and metadata associated with your form and spreadsheet.<br></p>
            <h2>2. What information does Form Approvals gather/track and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>  PERSONAL INFORMATION: The only personal information we store is the add-on administrator's email address. Upgrading to a paid plan requires us to also collect billing and payment information via one of our PCI compliant payment processing partners such as Stripe. We do not store your form response data and we do not store your approval records. Your form response data is stored by Google in your spreadsheet as part of normal Google Forms functionality. We add the approval records to the same spreadsheet and access the information from the spreadsheet using the authorization that you provide to the service. Further details about the add-on's authorization can be found on our Security Overview.
            <br>
            <br>
            BUSINESS INFORMATION: The application stores file metadata (e.g your Google Form Id and Google Sheet Id) to be able to process the information received from workflow participants.
            <br>
            <br>
            SECURITY INFORMATION: Form Approvals may collect certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other unique identifying information. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services.
            <br>
            <br>
            We will not view any of your information except as necessary to appropriately support the service, for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by law.
            <br>
            <br>
            We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not share your personal information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2>3. Can I request that my data is deleted?</h2>
            <p> In accordance with GDPR, CCPA and other global legislation you have a 'right to be forgotten'. If you wish to cancel your account and have all your data removed, follow these steps in the order provided:
              <br>
              <br>
            On each of your forms, open the add-on > click the question mark icon (in the bottom right corner) > click Restore defaults > then click the Restore defaults button. This will disable the add-on and delete all add-on settings data from your form (e.g recipient email addresses). We cannot perform this step for you.
            <br>
            <br>Remove the add-on's authorization to your account via Google's third party app permissions page; and
            <br>
            <br>
            Contact support@formapprovals.com: i) providing the email address of the user(s) that configured the add-on; ii) confirming you have already followed the above steps; and iii) confirming that you no longer intend on using the add-on and want all data stored outside of your G Suite files deleted.
          
            <br>  <br>Note, all form responses and approval records are stored within your spreadsheet and therefore are not able to be deleted by us, but can be deleted by you at any time.
